### Netflix Data Cleaning & Visualization Project

This project focuses on **cleaning and analyzing a real-world Netflix dataset** with an emphasis on **handling missing data without removing any rows or columns**.

---

### 🔧 Data Cleaning

The original dataset contained missing values across multiple columns, including:

 - director, cast, country
 - date_added, rating, duration

Using **Python and Pandas**, all missing values were handled systematically while preserving **100% of the original data**.

**Result after cleaning:**

 - All columns contain **0 null values**
 - No rows or columns were dropped
 - Dataset integrity fully preserved

This approach improves data reliability and avoids bias caused by data deletion.

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations

Using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, the following analyses and visualizations were created:

 - Content type distribution
 - Content added over time
 - Top producing countries
 - Genre and category popularity
 - Rating distribution and audience targeting
 - Movie duration analysis
 - TV shows seasons analysis
 - Top directors and cast members
 - Release year vs date added analysis
 - Missing data audit (before vs after cleaning)
 - Netflix content added over time by type
 - Top producing countries by content type

Visualization techniques used include **bar plots, line plots, box plots, scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts**.
